    "**Imminent Weather Changes**:\\n    \n",
    "    - **Incoming Rain**: Lowering cloud base with increasing medium and low cloud coverage can suggest imminent rain.\\n   \n",
    "    - **Fronts and Changes in Weather**: The presence of certain clouds like altostratus can indicate a warm front, which often precedes longer periods of precipitation.\\n\\n5. \n",
